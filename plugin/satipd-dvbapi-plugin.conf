#softcam plugin for satipd configuration file
#
#please note: there are quite valid reasons to use a softcam, e.g. puppies
#detecting new things to chew on every day - things like card sharing,
#however, are neither a valid reason, nor endorsed in any way
#
#There must by 1 to 32 [softcam] sections, each having a unique deviceid value
#which needs to match the deviceid of the associated tuner.
#There may be one [transponders] section.
#
#A [softcam] section defines one or more smartcards attached to a tuner
#via a softcam in dvbapi network mode.
#If oscam is used (must be a recent version supporting api version 2) as
#softcam dvbapi must be configured as follows:
#[dvbapi]
#enabled = 1
#user = <user>
#au = 1
#pmt_mode = 4
#request_mode = 0
#listen_port = <port>
#boxtype = pc
#ecminfo_type = 0
#read_sdt = 0
#write_sdt_prov = 0
#
#Up to eight program streams of a tuner can be processed. Parameters of a
#[softcam] section:
#
#host=              IP of the softcam host (either v4 or v6, no hostnames)
#port=1-65535       port the softcam is listening on
#deviceid=1-65535   deviceid of the tuner this softcam is associated to
#adapter=0-255      softcam adapter number (must be unique for all softcam
#                   users)
#caids=CAID[,...]   comma separated list of CAIDs as four digit hexadecimal
#                   numbers for which the smartcard inserted into the cam
#                   is responsible, if not specified any encrypted program
#                   will be tried with this smartcard, no default
#maxdecode=1-8      maximum amount of programs to decode in parallel,
#                   set bufferkb of satiploopd configuration to
#                   64*maxdecode if csamode is 3, otherwise 32*maxdecode
#pmtfilter=0-1      set to 1 if the PMT data passed to the cam can be filtered
#                   by the CAIDs specified (affects 'streampids', too),
#                   default is 0, do set to 1 if possible
#csamode=0-3        csa descrambling mode 0=int32,1=long64,2=mmx,3=sse2
#                   (modes 2 and 3 only on x86 platforms)
#ignore=SID[,...]   comma separated list of SIDs (program numbers, see e.g.
#                   satellite listings) for which this softcam shall be ignored
#
#Example:
#[softcam]
#host=192.168.0.1
#port=1234
#deviceid=1
#adapter=0
#caids=1843
#maxdecode=1
#pmtfilter=1
#csamode=3
#
#The [transponders] section, if specified, whitelists transponders for
#smartcard processing. Transponders not listed are not processed. If
#this section is not specified all transponders are processed.
#
#Example:
#[transponders]
#?src=1&freq=11464.250&pol=h&ro=0.35&msys=dvbs2&mtype=8psk&sr=22000&fec=23&pids=none
