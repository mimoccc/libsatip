#There must by one to eight [card] sections
#There may be one [transponders] section
#
#The [card] section defines a smartcard attached to a tuner via a cam.
#Up to eight smartcards can be attached to a tuner. Parameters of a
#[card] section:
#
#slot=1-8           cam slot of the tuner, specify 1 if there is only one
#                   slot, no default
#caids=CAID[,...]   comma separated list of CAIDs as four digit hexadecimal
#                   numbers for which the smartcard inserted into the cam
#                   is responsible, if not specified any encrypted program
#                   will be tried with this smartcard, no default
#maxdecode=1-8      amount of programs the cam can decode in parallel,
#                   typically 1 for most cams, no default
#pmtfilter=0-1      set to 1 if the PMT data passed to the cam can be filtered
#                   by the CAIDs specified (affects 'streampids', too),
#                   default is 0, do set to 1 if possible
#streampids=0-1     set to 1 if the CAT/ECM/EMM PIDs need to be requested
#                   explicitely from the tuner to be available for the cam,
#                   i.e. necessary for cams notbeing passed the full
#                   transponder stream, default is 0
#prefer=SID[,...]   comma separated list of SIDs (program numbers, see e.g.
#                   satellite listings) for which this card shall be used,
#                   in preference to other cards in other slots of the tuner
#ignore=SID[,...]   comma separated list of SIDs (program numbers, see e.g.
#                   satellite listings) for which this card shall be ignored
#
#Example:
#[card]
#slot=1
#caids=1843
#maxdecode=1
#pmtfilter=1
#
#The [transponders] section, if specified, whitelists transponders for
#smartcard processing. Transponders not listed are not processed. If
#this section is not specified all transponders are processed.
#
#Example:
#[transponders]
#?src=1&freq=11464.250&pol=h&ro=0.35&msys=dvbs2&mtype=8psk&sr=22000&fec=23&pids=none
