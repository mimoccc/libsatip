# libsatip
SAT>IP library for Linux, including example applications

A library for the SAT>IP protocol (see www.satip.info) allowing to easily
create SAT>IP clients and servers.  As documentation is, well, sparse,
example applications are included. These consist of a server, a client
providing a CUSE based loop device (thus no kernel patches required) and
several utilities.  For enhanced functionality of the example server and
loop device client some plugins are provided, too.

Licensing:
The shared library is licensed LGPLv2.1+, everything else (except where
stated otherwise) GPLv2.0.
